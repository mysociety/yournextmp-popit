{{ site_name }} is a volunteer-sourced database, and that means we constantly
need help in making it better.

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
There is a lot of useful information on candidates out there, so if you find
any please do add it to our site.

<h3>{% trans "Emails" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
At the moment we're trying to get as many email addresses on candidates as
we can.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
This will allow us to email them directly to ask them to add their own
details.

First off you'll need to <a href="{{ url }}">log in</a> in
order to start making edits.

{% url "finder" as url %}
<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
We've added clear banners on the candidate and constituently pages
indicating where we're missing email addresses, so you can start adding email
addresses by <a href="{{ url }}">looking up your constituency on the
home page</a>
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
Once you've found a candidate without an email address, you can go searching
for it!

Please make sure you read our <a

wXspA/edit">guidance on sourcing fields</a>, and specifically the part about
what sort of email addresses we accept.

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
In short, we only want email addresses could be considered public and
related to the candidate's campaign. <code>@parliament.uk</code> email
addresses will stop working once Parliament is disbanded, so try to find a
different email address for them if you can. If not, we can always email
everyone with a <code>@parliament.uk</code> address asking them for a better
one.

{% url "incomplete_view" 'email' as url %}
<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
Once your constituency has all the email addresses entered, you can look at
our <a href="{{ url }}">list of all candidates
without emails listed</a>!
